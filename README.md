# GoodTime

> You behave in Target and I'll let you play 20 minutes of Minecraft when we get home.

Some times you need to bargain with a 4 year old. 

GoodTime is a react native iOS app that hits the two birds of helping me learn react native and keep track of the time I bribe my son with. I'll admit it isn't very pretty, and isnt out on the appstore, but it works.  If for some reason you actually want it and dont want to build it from source, let me know and I'll send you a build in TestFlight.
